# Filters

App connector instance ids and knowledge-base / record-group ids that narrow retrieval
for a turn. For **org assistant** chat streams, send explicit `apps` / `kb` lists.
For **agent** chat streams, send explicit id lists, or **omit** `filters` (and `tools`)
to let the service use the agent’s stored knowledge and tool configuration. Sending
`{ "apps": [], "kb": [] }` on an agent stream means **no** knowledge sources for that
turn (it is not “full org default”).
