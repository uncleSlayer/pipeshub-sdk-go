# SemanticSearchHistoryFiltersApplied

Echo of which filters the caller actually supplied, built by
`buildFiltersMetadata` (utils.ts:430-486). `page` and `limit` always
appear because they are normalised to defaults before being recorded,
so `filters` is never empty and `values` always contains at least
`{ page, limit }`. Other keys appear only when the matching query
param was non-empty (or, for `dateRange`, when `createdAt` was set
on the Mongo filter).

`values` keys are scalar strings rather than typed primitives
(`'true'`/`'false'`, `'5'`, etc.) because they are passed through
from `req.query` as Express parsed them — only `page` and `limit`
are coerced to integers via `safeParsePagination`.
